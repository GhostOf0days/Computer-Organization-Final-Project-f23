Address Value Code
        ORG 100      / Fibonacci number 11 calculation
Load  TempCounter / Load the loop counter (9)
Store Counter / Store the loop counter into counter
Load FibNum0 / Load FibNum0 into AC
Store   FibNum1     / Store the the first operand into the second
Loop, Load FibNum1     / Load first fibonacci operand into AC
Add FibNum0 / Add the first operand to the second operand 
Store   FibNum2 / Store result into second (second = 0, will be updated later)
Load FibNum1 / Load the second fibonacci operand into AC
Store FibNum0 / Store the second fibonacci operand into the first 
Load FibNum2  / Store second operand into first
Store FibNum1 / Store the second operand into the the first 
Load  Counter / Load  Counter into AC
Add Decrement / Decrement to the counter 
Store Counter / Update Counter
Skip 400 / Check if loop counter is 0 and end
Jump    Loop        / Jump back to the loop start
Halt               / End of the program
FibNum0, Dec  0     / Initial value of first fibonacci operand
FibNum1, Dec  1     / Initial value of second fibonacci operand
FibNum2, Dec  0     / Initial value for fibonacci nuber
TempCounter, Dec 9         / Counter set to 11 for F11
Counter, Hex 0       / Temporary counter for loop control
Decrement, Dec -1        / Used to decrement by 1
